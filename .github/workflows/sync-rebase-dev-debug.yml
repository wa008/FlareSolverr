    steps:
      # 1. Check out your forked repository
      # fetch-depth: 0 is crucial. It fetches the entire Git history,
      # which is required for a successful rebase.
      - name: Checkout target repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          # The GITHUB_TOKEN is required to push changes back to your repo
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} 

      # 2. Configure Git User
      # Sets the author for any commits made by this action (like the merge commit)
      - name: Set Git user
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
          git config --global user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'

      # 3. Add the Upstream Remote
      # 'Upstream' is the original repository you forked from
      - name: Add upstream remote
        run: |
          # This is the original repository URL you provided
          git remote add upstream https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr.git
          
      # 4. Fetch all updates from the upstream remote
      - name: Fetch upstream
        run: git fetch upstream

      # --- KEY SYNC STEPS ---

      # 5. Sync your master branch
      # This ensures your fork's 'master' branch is an exact mirror of the upstream 'master'.
      - name: Sync master branch
        run: |

          # Force-push this change to your fork's 'master' branch
          git push origin master --force

      # 6. Rebase your custom branch
      # This is the core logic: apply your changes on top of the newly updated 'master'.
      - name: Rebase custom branch
        run: |
          # Checkout your 'dev_debug' branch
          git checkout dev_debug
          
          # This command will fail (exit non-zero) if conflicts are found
          git rebase master
            
      # 7. Push rebased branch (only runs if Step 6 succeeded)
      - name: Push rebased branch
        run: |
          # Push the changes to your 'dev_debug' branch
          # Use --force-with-lease for a safer force push
          git push origin dev_debug --force-with-lease
          
      # 8. Notify on Conflict (only runs if Step 6 failed)
      # The 'if: failure()' condition catches the failed 'git rebase' step.
      - name: Notify on conflict
        if: failure()
        run: |
          echo "!!! REBASE CONFLICT !!!"
          echo "Automatic rebase failed. Please resolve conflicts manually."

          # This exit 1 ensures the entire workflow is marked as "failed"
          exit 1
